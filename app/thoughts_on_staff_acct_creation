Perhaps the account registration page should only service public users.

Admin account creation should not be available to the general public.
Instead, we can create an add_admin_acct.py module, and db administrator
can call this from CLI to add new admin users.

Not sure if this is the proper way to implement it. But it seems more secure,
as creation privilege is much more limited
